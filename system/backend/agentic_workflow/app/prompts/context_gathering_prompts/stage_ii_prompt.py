- Business context and industry patterns
- Previous output of the SECOND stage (if any)
</INPUT_CONTEXT>

3. Map interaction patterns and user actions available on each screen
4. Consider responsive design needs and mobile-first approach
5. Ensure logical flow between screens and identify connection points
6. Ensure zero feature loss during requirement analysis
6. NEVER infer any new screens, only use the screens that are provided in the <OUTPUT_FROM_FIRST_STAGE> tags having field `screens`
</INSTRUCTIONS>

<OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS>
- Provide structured JSON output wrapped in <OUTPUT> tags, only the requested JSON is required, no other text or comments
- Include clear rationale for each screen's requirements
- Focus on functional requirements rather than visual design by considering the users UX and UI needs.
- Ensure data requirements are realistic and actionable
- If the previous output of the SECOND stage is present then just extend it by adding the new screens and their requirements and provide the extended output in the <OUTPUT> tags
- For providing the description at the required places, make sure to provide it in a manner that it indicates deeper reasoning and understanding of the users needs.
