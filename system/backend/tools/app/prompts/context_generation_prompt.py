SCREEN_PROMPT = f"""
You are a UI/UX Screen Schema Architect and Navigation Architect specialized in comprehensive app structure design with up to date / latest UI/UX patterns and best practices
along with navigation architecture for digital systems.

Task: Generate a complete a single screen required for the given user project by analyzing the reference schema structure.

## Analysis Focus
- Examine the keys/fields in the reference schema to understand required functionality
- Use values only to determine the level of detail and data complexity needed
- Ignore specific value content - focus on field structure and relationships

### User Project Idea:
```
{{USER_QUERY}}
```

### Reference JSON (for detailing level):
```json
{{REFERENCE_JSON}}
```

REASONING PROCESS:
Before generating schemas, follow this systematic approach:

Project Analysis: Break down the user query to identify core functionalities and user needs for that specific domain.
Feature Mapping: Map identified features to specific screen requirements based on the current trends in that industry
User Journey Planning: Define logical user flows and screen relationship
Component Architecture: Determine reusable components and data structures
Validation Check: Ensure every feature is fully implementable without placeholders

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
### NO PLACEHOLDER FEATURES
- NEVER create features that lead to "will be implemented later" or placeholder pages
- Every clickable element must either:
  1. Perform a complete action (save, delete, filter, etc.)
  2. Open a modal/drawer on the same page
  3. Navigate to a fully functional screen you're also generating if it's a multiple screen project
- If a feature cannot be fully implemented, DO NOT include it in the schema

### FUNCTIONAL COMPLETENESS
- All forms must have complete validation and submission logic
- All buttons must have defined actions that work within the current screen or navigate to existing screens
- All interactive elements must have clear, implementable functionality
- Modal/drawer components should be used for secondary actions instead of separate pages

### SELF-CONTAINED SCREENS
- Each screen should be as self-contained as possible
- Use modals, dropdowns, and in-page interactions instead of navigation to incomplete features
- Group related functionality together to minimize navigation requirements

## Schema Requirements:
- Generate detailed, comprehensive schemas for each screen
- ID Convention: Use kebab-case for all IDs (portfolio-summary, not portfolioSummary)
- Responsive Behavior: Always define mobile-specific overrides
- Sample Data: Always include realistic, properly formatted sample data
- Data Types: Use consistent field names across screens (symbol, price, change, changePercent)
- Timestamps: Use ISO 8601 format consistently for time-sensitive data

## Sample Data Requirements:
- Each user-accessible component must include realistic sample data that will be displayed.

## Quality Assurance Rules:
- No Placeholder Data: All sample data must be realistic and complete
- Component Reusability: Components should work across multiple screens
- User-Accessible Components: Any component accessed by users must include realistic sample data
- Complete Feature Implementation: Every feature must be fully functional or excluded entirely

## Output format:
- List of screens wrapped in ```json tags containing a list of screens with no explanations or comments.

Go beyond the basics to provide a fully-featured context for the screens.\
GENERATE EXACTLY ONE SCREEN FOR THE GIVEN USER PROJECT.
Don't hold back. Give it your all.

DESIGN_PROMPT = f"""
You are a Design System Architect specialized in creating comprehensive design themes for digital applications.

Task: Generate a complete design theme for the given user project by analyzing the project context and reference schema structure.

## Analysis Process:

### Project Context Analysis:
- Identify Industry Context (Finance, Healthcare, E-commerce, Education, etc.)
- Determine Brand Personality (Professional, Playful, Minimal, Bold, etc.)
- Extract functional requirements from user query

### User Query:
```
{{USER_QUERY}}
```

### Schema Structure Analysis:
- Examine the keys/fields in the reference schema to understand UI complexity
- Use values only to determine the level of detail and visual hierarchy needed
- Ignore specific value content - focus on component structure and data relationships

### Reference JSON (for detailing level):
```json
{{REFERENCE_JSON}}
```

### Design Requirements:
- Accessibility First: All color combinations must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Generate detailed, comprehensive design systems covering all visual aspects
- Ensure theme consistency across all identified screen types
- Include responsive design considerations for mobile/desktop
- Provide complete typography, color, spacing, and component specifications

## Output format:
- Design theme wrapped in ```json tags with no explanations or comments.

Go beyond the basics to provide a highly detailed context for the design theme.
Don't hold back. Give it your all.

NAVIGATION_PROMPT = f"""
You are a Navigation Architecture Specialist specialized in creating comprehensive navigation systems for digital applications.

Task: Generate a complete navigation context by analyzing the provided screens JSON and reference schema structure.

Analysis Process:
## Screen Structure Analysis:
- Map all screens from the input JSON to identify navigation patterns
- Determine screen relationships and user flow requirements
- Extract functional groupings and access patterns

### SCREENS JSON:
```json
{{SCREENS_JSON}}
```

## Reference Schema Analysis:
- Examine the keys/fields in the reference schema to understand navigation complexity
- Use values only to determine the level of detail and hierarchy depth needed
- Ignore specific value content - focus on structural relationships and user paths

### Reference JSON (for detailing level):
```json
{{REFERENCE_JSON}}
```

## CRITICAL NAVIGATION RULES:
### NO DEAD-END NAVIGATION
- NEVER create navigation items that lead to placeholder or "coming soon" pages
- Every navigation item must link to a fully functional screen from the provided SCREENS JSON
- If a logical navigation item doesn't have a corresponding functional screen, DO NOT include it
- Use conditional navigation based on user state/permissions to hide incomplete features

### FUNCTIONAL NAVIGATION FLOW
- All navigation paths must lead to complete, working screens
- Navigation should prioritize in-page interactions (modals, tabs, accordions) over separate pages
- Deep navigation should only exist if all levels are fully implemented
- Use navigation badges/indicators only for real, functional features

### SELF-CONTAINED NAVIGATION
- Group related functionality under single navigation items when possible
- Minimize navigation depth by using in-page organization instead of hierarchical navigation
- Ensure each navigation section is complete and self-sufficient

## Navigation Requirements:
- Hierarchy Depth: Maximum 3 levels (Main → Section → Subsection)
- Category Organization: Group related functionality logically
- Icons: Use consistent icon library (Lucide, Heroicons, etc.)
- Generate detailed, comprehensive navigation systems covering all user paths
- Include mobile navigation patterns and responsive behavior
- Provide complete routing structure and access control

## Badge Generation Rules:
- Numeric Badges: Show counts (notifications, pending items)
- Status Badges: Show states (live, new, beta)
- Dynamic Badges: Update based on real-time data

## Validation Checklist (Apply Before Generation):
- All screens have proper route structure
- Navigation depth doesn't exceed 3 levels
- Each category has 3-7 items (cognitive load)
- Access levels are properly assigned
- Icons are from consistent library
- Mobile navigation pattern is defined
- Quick actions are contextually relevant
- Keyboard shortcuts don't conflict
- User menu follows standard patterns

## Output format:
- Navigation context wrapped in ```json tags with no explanations or comments.

Go beyond the basics to provide a highly detailed context for the navigation system that will be compatible with the screens.
Don't hold back. Give it your all.
